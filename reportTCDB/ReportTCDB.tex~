\section{Structure of TCDB}
\label{}
TCDB is a 5-levels taxonomy of transport proteins structured according to a tree
We have the following per-level distribution of the $12587$ classes (from top to bottom):
\begin{enumerate}
\item level 1: 7  
\item level 2: 30
\item level 3: 867
\item level 4: 2235
\item level 5: 9448 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Characteristics of the levels}
\label{}
The TC-DB website details a comprehensive classification system for membrane transport proteins known as the Transport Classification (TC) system. The TC system is analogous to the Enzyme Commission (EC) system for classification of enzymes, except that it incorporates both functional and phylogenetic information. 
Basically the taxonomy is based on the mode of action of the transport activity, the type of energy used for the transport and the substrate on which the transporters act.
This is coded in a 5 components codes V.W.X.Y.Z, where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item W (a number): the first level of the hierarchy, i.e. the class of the trasport protein. It corresponds to th most general classes of the taxonomy.
\item V (a letter): the second level of the hierarchy, i.e. the subclass of the trasport protein. 
\item X (a number): the third level of the hierarchy, i.e. the family (sometimes the superfamily) of the trasport protein. 
\item Y (a number): the fourth level of the hierarchy, i.e. the subfamily  
\item Z (a number): the fifth level of the hierarchy is mostly related to the substrate(s) on which the transport proteins acts. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{The data}
\label{}

An R function is available to automatically parse  any tcdb text file to automatically extract all the available fields
(Swissport AC, TCDB code, description of the protein, gene name,  etc).
A library of R function is avaialble for parsing the tcdb text files, construct annotations table, construct the taxonomy tree,
providing some basic statistics on the TCDB annotations.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Taxonomy data}
\label{}

Data of the TCDB tree are just available as graphNEL R classes or as edges in plain text files.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The annotation data}
\label{}

These data are just available in tabular form in both .rda R compressed files and plain text files.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The input feature data}
\label{}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{BLAST-based data}
BLAST all vs all with TCDB proteins --> symmetric similarity matrix,

For unannotated proteins BLAST against all the TCDB proteins to obtain a feature vector.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{InterPro feature data}
This data for SwissProt proteins can be extracted for UniProtKB text files.

We need to choose which features should be included.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{TransMembrane Segments (TMS) data}

Available in some way from the TCDB (unfortunately there are not text files avaialble but only data on a per-protein basis on the TCDB web-site).
TMS data maybe could be extracted from FASTA sequences using the HMMTOP program or other similar programs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{PDB-based data}

We need to extract proper  features from the available data
