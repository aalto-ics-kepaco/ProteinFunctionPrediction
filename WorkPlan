-- Preliminary experiments to evaluate the predictability of the TCDB classes

A. Experiments using BLAST data and the about 12000 proteins having at least 1 annotation. We should exlude TCDB classes
having only 1 annotation, thus resulting in about 3414 classes (TCDB release 7 june 2015).
Metrics: AUC per class  and precision at different level of recall. Evaluation: leave-one-out (loo). 
Results averaged across classes, across levels, and per class. 
    1. BLAST (best hit?) as (strong) baseline  (Su?)
    2. Nearest Neighbour 
		3. RANKS (Giorgio)		
		4. linear SVM? 	
		
B. Selection of the InterPro features most informative for the prediction of transport proteins
C. Definition of other non-InterPro features most meaningful for the prediction of transport proteins (e.g. TMS data)
